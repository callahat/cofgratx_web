COFGRATX
========

Is a context free grammar parser and translator written around 2009. The main class was created mostly to automate the task of searching and replacing deprecated/removed method calls back when active record got rid of the find_first and find_all methods. This was quickly written to replace most occurances within a codebase and then tossed into a web front end. It has been mostly mothballed since and not much time has been spent refactoring it and making the code nicer.

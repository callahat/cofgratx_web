===================================
Upgrading to use ruby 2.0.0 and rails 3.2.11
Upgrading tests, mailer, and other files.


master - 2015-03-17
===================================
Added a test to see if self referential rules (or rules where the first production is
another rule) would go down until the stack ran out. The answer is yes. So for now, 
grammars defined should not have a rule as a first part of a rule or this will
happen: SystemStackError - has gone too deep.
